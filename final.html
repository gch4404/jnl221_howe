			<h3>What is a water main break, and what does it mean?</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<p>A water main break occurs when the underground pipes that transport water to homes, businesses, and institutions rupture or crack. These pipes are typically made of materials like cast iron, ductile iron, or concrete, and they tend to deteriorate over time due to factors such as age, corrosion, temperature changes as well as pressure fluctuations. When a break happens, it usually leads to the sudden loss of water pressure, and if left for too long can lead to flooding, and the disruption of water supply to affected areas. In terms of impact, they usually have instant minor impacts on the immediate area, as well as nearby residences and businesses that might get their water from said main. It can cause property damage, road closures, traffic disruptions, and potentially pose health hazards if contaminated water enters the system.
Repairing a water main break requires specialized equipment and skilled personnel, and depending on the severity of the break and its location, it can take hours or even days to fix. In the meantime, residents and businesses may experience inconvenience, financial losses, and potential safety concerns. Some business owners in the Syracuse area have previously attested to this. For example, back in January, Funk Nâ€™ Waffles manager Joe Capobianco talked to Syracuse.com as the city readied for potential issues due to rapidly-changing and inconsistent temperatures at the time. "It definitely affects us when it does happen because we need to have running water and hot water to make sure that everything is clean", he said.

			<h3>Where are the breaks happening? </h3>
			
			<p>Some areas of Syracuse are experiencing more breaks on average than others. Take the Northside neighborhood for example. One of the largest neighborhoods in the city, spanning almost four square miles, Northside is a very important residential and commercial center for the city. In the year 2022, the neighborhood experienced 16 isolated incidents of water main-related infrastructure issues, as shown in the chart below. This number must be also qualified slightly, in that the main Northside neighborhood also has smaller sub-neighborhoods within it, like Near Northside, Little Italy and Hawley-Green, which are their own separate points in the data because they are considered by the city to be practically their own neighborhoods. (<a href="https://cnycentral.com/news/local/syracuse-readies-for-possible-water-main-breaks-in-fluctuating-temperatures">CNY Central Article</a>). Adding the sub-neighborhood numbers makes the situation even more dire for Northside. Of course, part of the reason why it seems there were so many issues is because of its sheer size, but that is simply an explanation and not an excuse. Because it is so large, then the city should be able to crack down and focus on that area more, given how much more of an effect a singular break would have over other areas. Another disproportionately affected area was the Meadowbrook neighborhood, itself a residential hub of the city. Meadowbrook also experienced 16 incidents in 2022. Clearly, certain areas of Syracuse experience more problems with water main breaks than others. When asked exactly how the city deals with water main breaks both in general and how they manage specific neighborhoods that have issues more than others, both the Onondaga County Water Authority and the Public Works Department of Syracuse declined to comment.

			<h3> 'Tis the season...for breaks? </h3>

			<p>So, it is clear some locations in Syracuse have more water main troubles than others, but that raises a second question; what particular times of this year is this most problematic? For Syracuse, the results are largely to be expected. The chart below shows the amount of water main breaks by month in 2022, and a bit of math shows that Syracuse deals with the most water main breaks and adjacent infrastructure issues during the winter months on average. During the winter months, considered in this case as December through February, a total of 85 water main issues were documented. The spring months (March-May) had 63 individual incidents, the summer (June-August) had 36, and the fall (September-November) had 40. In general, it seems the colder the temperature, the more that water mains and general infrastructure need attention to be properly maintained. It is also worth mentioning that the city of Syracuse on average sees about 300 breakdowns per year. So, in this way, 2022 is actually a bit of a down year, only seeing 224 total. Going back one year to 2021, 203 separate incidents are documented. (<a href="https://data.syr.gov/datasets/878ca59054844cacac17919aa16f3bb4_0/explore?location=43.037395%2C-76.142026%2C12.02&showTable=true">2021 SYR Water Main Break Data</a>). The idea that the average seems to be trending down in recent years is a good sign. Efforts that both the city at large as well as the people in it seem to be helping the cause. In the same aforementioned January article, Syracuse DPW 1st Deputy Commissioner Ann Fordock suggested for citizens to turn their water on in a slight trickle to keep pipes from freezing in colder temperatures, especially at first onset during the year. Strategies like these, as well as efforts from the city themselves to maintain older infrastructure, seems to be helping in getting the average number of breakdowns city-wide. But, the fact remains, there are some areas still at greater risk during certain times of the year, and the city would do well to remain on top of it.</p>
